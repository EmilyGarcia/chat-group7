#GROUP 7'S README.md
##Names of your team members, including how you distributed the work between your team members.  
* Angel "Romance" Gonzalez
* Emily "Egg" Garcia
* Nancy "mikamiisbae" Gomez
##Write about your strategy for handling the “interfaces” between each other’s code. 
Pretty simple actually, we just sat down with each other, worked on the code until someone breaks it and we fix it together.
##What are known problems, if any, with your project?
It's pretty ugly and basic, and we still haven't gotten to the part where we get our main project to work. 
##It could use something like, pizzaz, or UI improvements to make it more user friendly and less ugly.
How would you improve it if you had more time?
